# Client Questions — Converra Website

Use this checklist when talking to the client so the site looks great and feels complete.

## Brand & identity

- [ ] **Logo & favicon** — Do you have final, high-res logo files (light/dark versions if needed)? Any rules on minimum size or clear space?
- [ ] **Brand colors** — Are teal/slate the official brand colors, or do you have a hex/Pantone palette we must use?
- [ ] **Tone of voice** — Formal vs. casual? More “enterprise” or “startup”? Any words or phrases to always use or avoid?
- [ ] **Tagline** — Is there an official tagline that should appear in the header, hero, or footer?

## Hero & above-the-fold

- [ ] **Headline** — Is “Revenue Partners for Tech Companies That Want to Scale” the final line, or do you have a preferred headline?
- [ ] **Subheadline** — Any change to the current value proposition (e.g. SDRs, headcount, revenue engine)?
- [ ] **Primary CTA** — Should the main button say “Become a Revenue Partner”, “Book a Call”, or something else?
- [ ] **Secondary CTA** — Keep “Book Strategy Call” or use a different label (e.g. “See how it works”)?
